Must be work authorized and emphasis on outstanding communication skills TRULY AWESOME Fintech opportunity for Junior to Mid-level candidates - High GPA, high potential with any strong CS code skillset Somerville, MA - VERY HIGH Bar here 5-6 junior roles (0-5 yrs) and 1 mid-level role with lead potential (must know Java) and 1-2 senior roles - fintech is ideal Our client has beautiful, modern offices very sharp group of candidates profitable and doing very well.\n\nBivium has placed a number of junior & associate engineers here, who LOVE the cultural, technical and business problems! Our client is a small company (currently 84 employees) that specializes in the financial space, specifically in the securities settlements realm.\n\nWe maintain fairly strict hiring standards. Our basic junior hiring guidelines are : candidates must have an undergrad gpa of at least 3.\n\n3 / 4.0 and have majored in computer science or related field (or demonstrated an interest in programming through electives / summer jobs / etc) candidates should have 0-7 years experience we take more experienced candidates with relevant experience (eg programming in financial realm), but as most new employees come in, in a junior role, we do not usually hire people with >\n\n5 yrs unrelated experience candidates must have desire to "learn the business" we market ourselves as software developers and IT consultants who know the securities settlements business as well as our clients doA bit more information about us.\n\nWe consider ourselves to be "technology agnostic" that is we hire people without the expectation that they are experienced in any one technology, but they are smart enough and interested enough to become proficient in any technology that we may require.\n\nThat said, it is certainly the case that most of our client work is in the most common technologies we see a lot of Java and Python, various database platforms).\n\nWe have even hired people without much of a programming experience to speak of (perhaps only a class taken as an elective) but who demonstrate strong analytical ability and a desire to learn more about software engineering.\n\nOne of the biggest distinctions between us and our competitors is the value we place on learning the business. We view ourselves as somewhere between the technology and the business space, and as such many of our associates complete tasks that would traditionally fall under more of a business analyst role (in addition to software development, not instead of).\n\nWe are client facing consultants, not just heads down coders, so written and oral communication skills are very important and we generally hire either junior developers (0-5 yrs experience) or more experienced developers with experience relevant to our field.\n\ne., 5+ years). Many people do technical work at financial firms and solve only technical problems without learning too much about the business processes that they are supporting.\n\nThe extremely rare successful experienced candidate writes software to solve business problems (not technical problems) in back-office areas such as settlements, clearing, and accounting.\n\nWorking in other areas such as stock borrow / stock loan, prime brokerage, position keeping systems, etc., are also relevant.\n\nWhy someone would want to come here : I think the shortest answer is that we are the best of all worlds. We are a small company with a small company feel (great coworkers, no red tape, flexible schedules, casual dress code) but do work for some of the largest companies in the world in some of the most relevant and cutting-edge projects.\n\nThe owners of the firm place a high value on the people working for them, and new employees will immediately have relevant work to do, and not spend their first year merely testing someone else\'s code.\n\nThe company is also very good at rewarding hard work.
